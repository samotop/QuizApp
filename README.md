# QuizApp
This project served as a hands-on exercise to apply programming knowledge gained through learning. It is a straightforward quiz application. The application works by retrieving 10 questions from the Open Trivia Database through an API every time it is launched.

<b>Here's how it functions:</b>

  1. The app fetches 10 questions from the Open Trivia Database API.
  
  2. The questions are presented to the user one by one.
  
  3. The user can mark each question as true or false based on its correctness.

  4. For every correct answer, the user earns 1 point.

This project demonstrates the integration of an external API into a quiz application, allowing users to test their knowledge and earn points based on their correct answers.
